# Policy Research — Overview

Status board for the incremental alpha-beta proof-policy project. See
[`plan.md`](plan.md) for the full specification (objectives, engineering rules, phases,
tests, exit gates, definition of done).

## Current state

| Phase | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Architecture inventory and mutation audit | **Complete** — reviewed at commit `d2e8a7dc`; decisions in `architecture-inventory.md` §10 |
| 1 | Deterministic research harness | **Complete** — corpus-v1 runner + run manifest; determinism gate passes (12 roots × depth 11). Hardened per review (see below) and gate regenerated with a fully identified executable |
| 2 | Versioned research logging | Not started |
| 3 | Observational dataset and calibration baseline | Not started |
| 4 | Root-level counterfactual experiments | Not started |
| 5 | Internal counterfactual search sandbox | Not started |
| 6 | Oracle / ratio / interaction-gap studies | Not started |
| 7 | Proof-time survival modeling | Not started |
| 8 | Exact and prototype Jacobian experiments | Not started |
| 9 | Teacher model | Not started |
| 10 | Incremental production student | Not started |
| 11 | Conservative engine integration | Not started |
| 12 | On-policy data generation (DAgger) | Not started |
| 13 | LMR shadow modeling | Not started |

## Phase 2 — engine-side scaffold progress

- Research compile flag `POLICY_RESEARCH` and zero-behavior UCI options
  (`PolicyResearch*`, see `src/policy_research/research_options.h`): **committed and
  verified** — research vs production builds of the same commit are node-identical
  (`bench 16 1 10 default depth` = 453 169 nodes for both).
- Options are registered through the canonical `make -C src research-build` target
  (objclean-first; plain `EXTRACXXFLAGS` reuse of stale objects is unsafe). Invalid
  option values are rejected in research builds: an `info string` diagnostic is
  emitted **and** the stored option value is rolled back (macro-gated change in
  `ucioption.cpp`), so the option map and `Research::config()` never disagree.
  `Research::enabled()` is the single canonical activation predicate; recorder
  phases must enforce a finite internal cap even when `PolicyResearchMaxRecords`
  is 0.

## Phase 1 hardening (review repair pass)

- Run manifests now record `engine_executable_sha256`, `engine_banner` (embedded
  source commit), and `build_command`, because repository HEAD alone does not
  identify the binary that ran (a PGO build of an older commit previously produced
  the gate evidence).
- Every root result must demonstrate a completed fixed-depth search (final depth,
  positive nodes, score, non-empty PV, or a mate announcement) before the
  determinism comparison runs; aborted searches cannot pass the gate.
- `SyzygyPath` is explicitly cleared and `UCI_Chess960` pinned false in every run;
  the value network must resolve or the run refuses to start.
- `compare_results` is symmetric (extra positions in run B are also failures).
- Corpus tag semantics are documented (`tag_semantics`) and the two incorrect
  `castling` tags corrected (metadata-only, recorded in `history`).
- Determinism gate re-verified from committed code with a fully identified
  executable; artifacts under `tools/policy_research/runs/` (git-ignored).

## Phase 0 deliverables

- `architecture-inventory.md` — exact code locations, flows, and integration points for
  Search, MovePicker, TT, worker state, Position, and NNUE.
- `search-mutation-audit.md` — every mutable object reachable from recursive search, with
  ownership, update sites, and counterfactual-isolation requirements.
- Open questions list (bottom of `architecture-inventory.md`).

## Phase 0 exit gate

> Do not continue until every mutable object reachable from recursive search has been
> accounted for.

Branch: `policy-research`. Base commit: `06675f70`.
