# Policy Research — Overview

Status board for the incremental alpha-beta proof-policy project. See
[`plan.md`](plan.md) for the full specification (objectives, engineering rules, phases,
tests, exit gates, definition of done).

## Current state

| Phase | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Architecture inventory and mutation audit | **Complete** — reviewed at commit `d2e8a7dc`; decisions in `architecture-inventory.md` §10 |
| 1 | Deterministic research harness | **Complete** — corpus-v1 runner + run manifest; determinism gate passes (12 roots × depth 11) |
| 2 | Versioned research logging | Not started |
| 3 | Observational dataset and calibration baseline | Not started |
| 4 | Root-level counterfactual experiments | Not started |
| 5 | Internal counterfactual search sandbox | Not started |
| 6 | Oracle / ratio / interaction-gap studies | Not started |
| 7 | Proof-time survival modeling | Not started |
| 8 | Exact and prototype Jacobian experiments | Not started |
| 9 | Teacher model | Not started |
| 10 | Incremental production student | Not started |
| 11 | Conservative engine integration | Not started |
| 12 | On-policy data generation (DAgger) | Not started |
| 13 | LMR shadow modeling | Not started |

## Phase 2 — engine-side scaffold progress

- Research compile flag `POLICY_RESEARCH` (`make build EXTRACXXFLAGS=-DPOLICY_RESEARCH`)
  and zero-behavior UCI options (`PolicyResearch*`, see
  `src/policy_research/research_options.h`): **committed and verified** — research vs
  production builds of the same commit are node-identical (`bench 16 1 10 default depth`
  = 453 169 nodes for both); invalid option values are rejected with `info string`
  diagnostics.

## Phase 0 deliverables

- `architecture-inventory.md` — exact code locations, flows, and integration points for
  Search, MovePicker, TT, worker state, Position, and NNUE.
- `search-mutation-audit.md` — every mutable object reachable from recursive search, with
  ownership, update sites, and counterfactual-isolation requirements.
- Open questions list (bottom of `architecture-inventory.md`).

## Phase 0 exit gate

> Do not continue until every mutable object reachable from recursive search has been
> accounted for.

Branch: `policy-research`. Base commit: `06675f70`.
